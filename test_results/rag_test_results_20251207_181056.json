      "answer": "Transformers use attention mechanisms as a way to build contextual representations of a token's meaning by attending to and integrating information from surrounding tokens. This helps the model learn how tokens relate to each other over large spans (Excerpt 2). The attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to attend to all the inputs up to, and including, a specific input (Excerpt 3). The actual attention head used in transformers is produced by a specific structured layer called an \"",

They lie at the heart of large language models and other modern applications (Excerpt 5). In static embeddings, each word is mapped to a fixed embedding (Excerpt 6). The concept of word embeddings is introduced as a helpful way to understand the representation of word meaning using vectors (Excerpt 3).",

They operate by considering a fixed window of previous words (n) and calculating the frequency of each n-gram (a contiguous sequence of n items from the training corpus) to predict the next word in a sentence.

It is a method of backward differentiation on a computation graph, which is particularly useful for neural networks. The intuition behind backpropagation is to pass gradients back from the final node to all the nodes in the graph (Excerpt 3). This process helps in training neural networks by optimization algorithms like gradient descent (Excerpt 2). It was invented specifically for ",
