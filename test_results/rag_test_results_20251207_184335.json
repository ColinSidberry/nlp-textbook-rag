This helps the model learn how tokens relate to each other over large spans. The actual attention head used in transformers is produced by a specific structured layer called an \"attention head\".

      "answer": "N-gram language models are a type of Markov model used to estimate words based on a fixed window of previous words. They offer a way to assign a probability to a sequence of words or tokens and predict a word from preceding words or tokens. The models can be trained by counting the occurrences of n-grams in a training corpus and normalizing them (Excerpt 2, Excerpt 3). The first work on n-gram language models was distributed as an IBM technical report in 1985 (Excerpt 1).",

It is a method used in natural language processing where information retrieval techniques are employed to retrieve documents that might help answer a question, and then a large language model is used to generate an answer based on the retrieved passages (Excerpt 1, Excerpt 2, Excerpt 4). The components of RAG are sometimes referred to as the retriever and the reader (Excerpt 1).",

It's specifically mentioned in the context as being instrumental for training neural networks (Excerpt 2). The intuition behind backpropagation is passing gradients back from the final node to all the nodes in the graph (Excerpt 3). This process is also referred to as backward differentiation, which depends on the notion of computation graphs (Excerpt 4 and Excerpt 5).",
