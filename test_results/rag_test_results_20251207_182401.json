      "answer": "Transformers use attention mechanisms as a way to build contextual representations of a token's meaning by attending to and integrating information from surrounding tokens. This helps the model learn how tokens relate to each other over large spans. The actual attention head used in transformers is produced by a specific structured layer called an \"attention head.\"",

      "answer": "Word embeddings are vector representations of the meaning of words that are learned directly from word distributions in texts. The term \"embedding\" derives historically from its mathematical sense as a mapping from one space or structure to another, although the meaning has shifted (as mentioned in Excerpt 2). In this context, an embedding is a fixed vector for each word, and these embeddings lie at the heart of large language models and other modern applications (as stated in Excerpt 5).",

      "answer": "N-gram language models are a type of Markov model that estimate words based on a fixed window of previous words. They offer a way to assign a probability to a sequence of words or tokens and predict a word from preceding words or tokens. The models can be trained by counting the occurrence of n-grams in a training corpus and normalizing them. The concept was first introduced by researchers at IBM and later extended by tools like SRILM (Stolcke, 2002).",

      "answer": "The term RAG refers to Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a method that combines information retrieval techniques with a large language model to generate responses based on retrieved documents. This method is used to answer questions by retrieving relevant passages and then generating an answer using a language model (Excerpt 1, Excerpt 2, Excerpt 3, Excerpt 4). The components of RAG are sometimes called the retriever and the reader (Excerpt 1).",

It is specifically mentioned as being important for training neural networks (Excerpt 2). The intuition behind backpropagation is passing gradients backwards from the final node to all the nodes in the graph (Excerpt 3). This process is also referred to as backward differentiation, which depends on the notion of computation graphs (Excerpt 4). A computation graph is a representati",
