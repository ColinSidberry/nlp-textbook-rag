 Six titles that are not constituents, from Geoffrey K. Pullum on
 Language Log (who was pointing out their incredible rarity).

 The study of grammar has an ancient pedigree. The grammar of Sanskrit was
 described by the Indian grammarian Pān.ini sometime between the 7th and 4th censyntax turies BCE, in his famous treatise the As.t.ādhyāyı̄ (‘8 books’). And our word syntax
 comes from the Greek sýntaxis, meaning “setting out together or arrangement”, and
 refers to the way words are arranged together. We have seen various syntactic notions in previous chapters: ordering of sequences of words (Chapter 2), probabilities
 for these word sequences (Chapter 3), and the use of part-of-speech categories as
 a grammatical equivalence class for words (Chapter 17). In this chapter and the
 next three we introduce a variety of syntactic phenomena that go well beyond these
 simpler approaches, together with formal models for capturing them in a computationally useful manner.
 The bulk of this chapter is devoted to context-free grammars. Context-free grammars are the backbone of many formal models of the syntax of natural language (and,
 for that matter, of computer languages). As such, they play a role in many computational applications, including grammar checking, semantic interpretation, dialogue
 understanding, and machine translation. They are powerful enough to express sophisticated relations among the words in a sentence, yet computationally tractable
 enough that efficient algorithms exist for parsing sentences with them (as we show in
 Chapter 18). Here we also introduce the concept of lexicalized grammars, focusing
 on one example, combinatory categorial grammar, or CCG.
 In Chapter 19 we introduce a formal model of grammar called syntactic dependencies that is an alternative to these constituency grammars, and we’ll give algorithms for dependency parsing. Both constituency and dependency formalisms are
 important for language processing.
 Finally, we provide a brief overview of the grammar of English, illustrated from
 a domain with relatively simple sentences called ATIS (Air Traffic Information System) (Hemphill et al., 1990). ATIS systems were an early spoken language system
 for users to book flights, by expressing sentences like I’d like to fly to Atlanta.

F.1 Constituency
 Syntactic constituency is the idea that groups of words can behave as single units,
 or constituents. Part of developing a grammar involves building an inventory of the
 constituents in the language. How do words group together in English? Consider
 noun phrase the noun phrase, a sequence of words surrounding at least one noun. Here are some
 examples of noun phrases (thanks to Damon Runyon):

 Harry the Horse a high-class spot such as Mindy’s
 the Broadway coppers the reason he comes into the Hot Box
 they three parties from Brooklyn
 What evidence do we have that these words group together (or “form constituents”)?
 One piece of evidence is that they can all appear in similar syntactic environments,
 for example, before a verb.

 three parties from Brooklyn arrive. . .
 a high-class spot such as Mindy’s attracts. . .
 the Broadway coppers love. . .
 they sit
 But while the whole noun phrase can occur before a verb, this is not true of each
 of the individual words that make up a noun phrase. The following are not grammatical sentences of English (recall that we use an asterisk (*) to mark fragments that
 are not grammatical English sentences):

 *from arrive. . . *as attracts. . .
 *the is. . . *spot sat. . .
 Thus, to correctly describe facts about the ordering of these words in English, we
 must be able to say things like “Noun Phrases can occur before verbs”.
 preposed Other kinds of evidence for constituency come from what are called preposed or
 postposed postposed constructions. For example, the prepositional phrase on September seventeenth can be placed in a number of different locations in the following examples,
 including at the beginning (preposed) or at the end (postposed):
 On September seventeenth, I’d like to fly from Atlanta to Denver
 I’d like to fly on September seventeenth from Atlanta to Denver
 I’d like to fly from Atlanta to Denver on September seventeenth
 But again, while the entire phrase can be placed differently, the individual words
 making up the phrase cannot be:
 *On September, I’d like to fly seventeenth from Atlanta to Denver
 *On I’d like to fly September seventeenth from Atlanta to Denver
 *I’d like to fly on September from Atlanta to Denver seventeenth

F.2 Context-Free Grammars
 The most widely used formal system for modeling constituent structure in English
 CFG and other natural languages is the Context-Free Grammar, or CFG. Context-
F.2 • C ONTEXT-F REE G RAMMARS 3

 free grammars are also called Phrase-Structure Grammars, and the formalism
 is equivalent to Backus-Naur Form, or BNF. The idea of basing a grammar on
 constituent structure dates back to the psychologist Wilhelm Wundt 1900 but was
 not formalized until Chomsky (1956) and, independently, Backus (1959).
 rules A context-free grammar consists of a set of rules or productions, each of which
 expresses the ways that symbols of the language can be grouped and ordered tolexicon gether, and a lexicon of words and symbols. For example, the following productions
 NP express that an NP (or noun phrase) can be composed of either a ProperNoun or
 a determiner (Det) followed by a Nominal; a Nominal in turn can consist of one or
 more Nouns.1

 NP → Det Nominal
 NP → ProperNoun
 Nominal → Noun | Nominal Noun

 Context-free rules can be hierarchically embedded, so we can combine the previous
 rules with others, like the following, that express facts about the lexicon:

 Det → a
 Det → the
 Noun → flight

 The symbols that are used in a CFG are divided into two classes. The symbols
 terminal that correspond to words in the language (“the”, “nightclub”) are called terminal
 symbols; the lexicon is the set of rules that introduce these terminal symbols. The
non-terminal symbols that express abstractions over these terminals are called non-terminals. In
 each context-free rule, the item to the right of the arrow (→) is an ordered list of one
 or more terminals and non-terminals; to the left of the arrow is a single non-terminal
 symbol expressing some cluster or generalization. The non-terminal associated with
 each word in the lexicon is its lexical category, or part of speech.
 A CFG can be thought of in two ways: as a device for generating sentences
 and as a device for assigning a structure to a given sentence. Viewing a CFG as a
 generator, we can read the → arrow as “rewrite the symbol on the left with the string
 of symbols on the right”.
 So starting from the symbol: NP
 we can use our first rule to rewrite NP as: Det Nominal
 and then rewrite Nominal as: Noun
 and finally rewrite these parts-of-speech as: a flight
 We say the string a flight can be derived from the non-terminal NP. Thus, a CFG
 can be used to generate a set of strings. This sequence of rule expansions is called a
 derivation derivation of the string of words. It is common to represent a derivation by a parse
 parse tree tree (commonly shown inverted with the root at the top). Figure F.1 shows the tree
 representation of this derivation.
 dominates In the parse tree shown in Fig. F.1, we can say that the node NP dominates all the
 nodes in the tree (Det, Nom, Noun, a, flight). We can say further that it immediately
 dominates the nodes Det and Nom.
 The formal language defined by a CFG is the set of strings that are derivable
start symbol from the designated start symbol. Each grammar must have one designated start
 1 When talking about these rules we can pronounce the rightarrow → as “goes to”, and so we might
 read the first rule above as “NP goes to Det Nominal”.

 symbol, which is often called S. Since context-free grammars are often used to define
 sentences, S is usually interpreted as the “sentence” node, and the set of strings that
 are derivable from S is the set of sentences in some simplified version of English.
 Let’s add a few additional rules to our inventory. The following rule expresses
 verb phrase the fact that a sentence can consist of a noun phrase followed by a verb phrase:
 S → NP VP I prefer a morning flight
 A verb phrase in English consists of a verb followed by assorted other things;
 for example, one kind of verb phrase consists of a verb followed by a noun phrase:
 VP → Verb NP prefer a morning flight
 Or the verb may be followed by a noun phrase and a prepositional phrase:
 VP → Verb NP PP leave Boston in the morning
 Or the verb phrase may have a verb followed by a prepositional phrase alone:
 VP → Verb PP leaving on Thursday
 A prepositional phrase generally has a preposition followed by a noun phrase.
 For example, a common type of prepositional phrase in the ATIS corpus is used to
 indicate location or direction:
 PP → Preposition NP from Los Angeles
 The NP inside a PP need not be a location; PPs are often used with times and
 dates, and with other nouns as well; they can be arbitrarily complex. Here are ten
 examples from the ATIS corpus:
 to Seattle on these flights
 in Minneapolis about the ground transportation in Chicago
 on Wednesday of the round trip flight on United Airlines
 in the evening of the AP fifty seven flight
 on the ninth of July with a stopover in Nashville
 Figure F.2 gives a sample lexicon, and Fig. F.3 summarizes the grammar rules
 we’ve seen so far, which we’ll call L0 . Note that we can use the or-symbol | to
 indicate that a non-terminal has alternate possible expansions.
 We can use this grammar to generate sentences of this “ATIS-language”. We
 start with S, expand it to NP VP, then choose a random expansion of NP (let’s say, to
 I), and a random expansion of VP (let’s say, to Verb NP), and so on until we generate
 the string I prefer a morning flight. Figure F.4 shows a parse tree that represents a
 complete derivation of I prefer a morning flight.
 We can also represent a parse tree in a more compact format called bracketed
 bracketed notation; here is the bracketed representation of the parse tree of Fig. F.4:

 A CFG like that of L0 defines a formal language. We saw in Chapter 2 that a formal language is a set of strings. Sentences (strings of words) that can be derived by a
 grammar are in the formal language defined by that grammar, and are called gramgrammatical matical sentences. Sentences that cannot be derived by a given formal grammar are
ungrammatical not in the language defined by that grammar and are referred to as ungrammatical.
6 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 This hard line between “in” and “out” characterizes all formal languages but is only
 a very simplified model of how natural languages really work. This is because determining whether a given sentence is part of a given natural language (say, English)
 often depends on the context. In linguistics, the use of formal languages to model
 generative
 grammar natural languages is called generative grammar since the language is defined by
 the set of possible sentences “generated” by the grammar.

 F.2.1 Formal Definition of Context-Free Grammar
 We conclude this section with a quick, formal description of a context-free grammar and the language it generates. A context-free grammar G is defined by four
 parameters: N, Σ, R, S (technically this is a “4-tuple”).

 N a set of non-terminal symbols (or variables)
 Σ a set of terminal symbols (disjoint from N)
 R a set of rules or productions, each of the form A → β ,
 where A is a non-terminal,
 β is a string of symbols from the infinite set of strings (Σ ∪ N)∗
 S a designated start symbol and a member of N

 For the remainder of the book we adhere to the following conventions when discussing the formal properties of context-free grammars (as opposed to explaining
 particular facts about English or other languages).
 Capital letters like A, B, and S Non-terminals
 S The start symbol
 Lower-case Greek letters like α, β , and γ Strings drawn from (Σ ∪ N)∗
 Lower-case Roman letters like u, v, and w Strings of terminals

 A language is defined through the concept of derivation. One string derives another one if it can be rewritten as the second one by some series of rule applications.
 More formally, following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979),
 if A → β is a production of R and α and γ are any strings in the set
directly derives (Σ ∪ N)∗ , then we say that αAγ directly derives αβ γ, or αAγ ⇒ αβ γ.
 Derivation is then a generalization of direct derivation:
 Let α1 , α2 , . . . , αm be strings in (Σ ∪ N)∗ , m ≥ 1, such that

 α1 ⇒ α2 , α2 ⇒ α3 , . . . , αm−1 ⇒ αm
 ∗
 derives We say that α1 derives αm , or α1 ⇒ αm .
 We can then formally define the language LG generated by a grammar G as the
 set of strings composed of terminal symbols that can be derived from the designated
 start symbol S.
 ∗
 LG = {w|w is in Σ∗ and S ⇒ w}
 The problem of mapping from a string of words to its parse tree is called synsyntactic
 parsing tactic parsing; we define algorithms for constituency parsing in Chapter 18.

F.3 Some Grammar Rules for English
 In this section, we introduce a few more aspects of the phrase structure of English;
 for consistency we will continue to focus on sentences from the ATIS domain. Because of space limitations, our discussion is necessarily limited to highlights. Readers are strongly advised to consult a good reference grammar of English, such as
 Huddleston and Pullum (2002).

 F.3.1 Sentence-Level Constructions
 In the small grammar L0 , we provided only one sentence-level construction for
 declarative sentences like I prefer a morning flight. Among the large number of
 constructions for English sentences, four are particularly common and important:
 declaratives, imperatives, yes-no questions, and wh-questions.
 declarative Sentences with declarative structure have a subject noun phrase followed by a
 verb phrase, like “I prefer a morning flight”. Sentences with this structure have a
 great number of different uses; here examples from the ATIS domain:
 I want a flight from Ontario to Chicago
 The flight should be eleven a.m. tomorrow
 The return flight should leave at around seven p.m.
 imperative Sentences with imperative structure often begin with a verb phrase and have
 no subject. They are called imperative because they are almost always used for
 commands and suggestions; in the ATIS domain they are commands to the system.
 Show the lowest fare
 Give me Sunday’s flights arriving in Las Vegas from New York City
 List all flights between five and seven p.m.
 We can model this sentence structure with another rule for the expansion of S:
 S → VP
yes-no question Sentences with yes-no question structure are often (though not always) used to
 ask questions; they begin with an auxiliary verb, followed by a subject NP, followed
 by a VP. Here are some examples. Note that the third example is not a question at
 all but a request.
 Do any of these flights have stops?
 Does American’s flight eighteen twenty five serve dinner?
 Can you give me the same information for United?
 Here’s the rule:
 S → Aux NP VP
 The most complex sentence-level structures we examine here are the various whwh-phrase structures. These are so named because one of their constituents is a wh-phrase, that
 wh-word is, one that includes a wh-word (who, whose, when, where, what, which, how, why).
 These may be broadly grouped into two classes of sentence-level structures. The
 wh-subject-question structure is identical to the declarative structure, except that
 the first noun phrase contains some wh-word.
 What airlines fly from Burbank to Denver?
 Which flights depart Burbank after noon and arrive in Denver by six p.m?
 Whose flights serve breakfast?
8 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 Here is a rule. Exercise F.7 discusses rules for the constituents that make up the
 Wh-NP.

 S → Wh-NP VP

wh-non-subject- In the wh-non-subject-question structure, the wh-phrase is not the subject of the
 question
 sentence, and so the sentence includes another subject. In these types of sentences
 the auxiliary appears before the subject NP, just as in the yes-no question structures.
 Here is an example followed by a sample rule:
 What flights do you have from Burbank to Tacoma Washington?

 S → Wh-NP Aux NP VP

 Constructions like the wh-non-subject-question contain what are called longlong-distance
 dependencies distance dependencies because the Wh-NP what flights is far away from the predicate that it is semantically related to, the main verb have in the VP. In some models
 of parsing and understanding compatible with the grammar rule above, long-distance
 dependencies like the relation between flights and have are thought of as a semantic
 relation. In such models, the job of figuring out that flights is the argument of have is
 done during semantic interpretation. Other models of parsing represent the relationship between flights and have as a syntactic relation, and the grammar is modified to
 insert a small marker called a trace or empty category after the verb. We discuss
 empty-category models when we introduce the Penn Treebank on page 15.

 F.3.2 Clauses and Sentences
 Before we move on, we should clarify the status of the S rules in the grammars we
 just described. S rules are intended to account for entire sentences that stand alone
 as fundamental units of discourse. However, S can also occur on the right-hand side
 of grammar rules and hence can be embedded within larger sentences. Clearly then,
 there’s more to being an S than just standing alone as a unit of discourse.
 What differentiates sentence constructions (i.e., the S rules) from the rest of the
 grammar is the notion that they are in some sense complete. In this way they correclause spond to the notion of a clause, which traditional grammars often describe as forming a complete thought. One way of making this notion of “complete thought” more
 precise is to say an S is a node of the parse tree below which the main verb of the S
 has all of its arguments. We define verbal arguments later, but for now let’s just see
 an illustration from the tree for I prefer a morning flight in Fig. F.4 on page 5. The
 verb prefer has two arguments: the subject I and the object a morning flight. One of
 the arguments appears below the VP node, but the other one, the subject NP, appears
 only below the S node.

 F.3.3 The Noun Phrase
 Our L0 grammar introduced three of the most frequent types of noun phrases that
 occur in English: pronouns, proper nouns and the NP → Det Nominal construction.
 The central focus of this section is on the last type since that is where the bulk of
 the syntactic complexity resides. These noun phrases consist of a head, the central
 noun in the noun phrase, along with various modifiers that can occur before or after
 the head noun. Let’s take a close look at the various parts.
 F.3 • S OME G RAMMAR RULES FOR E NGLISH 9

 The Determiner
 Noun phrases can begin with simple lexical determiners:
 a stop the flights this flight
 those flights any flights some flights
 The role of the determiner can also be filled by more complex expressions:
 United’s flight
 United’s pilot’s union
 Denver’s mayor’s mother’s canceled flight
 In these examples, the role of the determiner is filled by a possessive expression
 consisting of a noun phrase followed by an ’s as a possessive marker, as in the
 following rule.
 Det → NP 0 s
 The fact that this rule is recursive (since an NP can start with a Det) helps us model
 the last two examples above, in which a sequence of possessive expressions serves
 as a determiner.
 Under some circumstances determiners are optional in English. For example,
 determiners may be omitted if the noun they modify is plural:
 (F.2) Show me flights from San Francisco to Denver on weekdays
 As we saw in Chapter 17, mass nouns also don’t require determination. Recall that
 mass nouns often (not always) involve something that is treated like a substance
 (including e.g., water and snow), don’t take the indefinite article “a”, and don’t tend
 to pluralize. Many abstract nouns are mass nouns (music, homework). Mass nouns
 in the ATIS domain include breakfast, lunch, and dinner:
 (F.3) Does this flight serve dinner?

 The Nominal
 The nominal construction follows the determiner and contains any pre- and posthead noun modifiers. As indicated in grammar L0 , in its simplest form a nominal
 can consist of a single noun.
 Nominal → Noun
 As we’ll see, this rule also provides the basis for the bottom of various recursive
 rules used to capture more complex nominal constructions.

 Before the Head Noun
 A number of different kinds of word classes can appear before the head noun but
 cardinal after the determiner (the “postdeterminers”) in a nominal. These include cardinal
 numbers
 ordinal numbers, ordinal numbers, quantifiers, and adjectives. Examples of cardinal
 numbers
quantifiers numbers:
 two friends one stop
 Ordinal numbers include first, second, third, and so on, but also words like next,
 last, past, other, and another:
 the first one the next day the second leg
 the last flight the other American flight
 Some quantifiers (many, (a) few, several) occur only with plural count nouns:
10 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 many fares
 Adjectives occur after quantifiers but before nouns.
 a first-class fare a non-stop flight
 the longest layover the earliest lunch flight
 adjective
 phrase Adjectives can also be grouped into a phrase called an adjective phrase or AP.
 APs can have an adverb before the adjective (see Chapter 17 for definitions of adjectives and adverbs):
 the least expensive fare

 After the Head Noun
 A head noun can be followed by postmodifiers. Three kinds of nominal postmodifiers are common in English:
 prepositional phrases all flights from Cleveland
 non-finite clauses any flights arriving after eleven a.m.
 relative clauses a flight that serves breakfast
 They are especially common in the ATIS corpus since they are used to mark the
 origin and destination of flights.
 Here are some examples of prepositional phrase postmodifiers, with brackets
 inserted to show the boundaries of each PP; note that two or more PPs can be strung
 together within a single NP:
 all flights [from Cleveland] [to Newark]
 arrival [in San Jose] [before seven p.m.]
 a reservation [on flight six oh six] [from Tampa] [to Montreal]
 Here’s a new nominal rule to account for postnominal PPs:
 Nominal → Nominal PP
 non-finite The three most common kinds of non-finite postmodifiers are the gerundive (-
 ing), -ed, and infinitive forms.
 gerundive Gerundive postmodifiers are so called because they consist of a verb phrase that
 begins with the gerundive (-ing) form of the verb. Here are some examples:
 any of those [leaving on Thursday]
 any flights [arriving after eleven a.m.]
 flights [arriving within thirty minutes of each other]
 We can define the Nominals with gerundive modifiers as follows, making use of
 a new non-terminal GerundVP:
 Nominal → Nominal GerundVP
 We can make rules for GerundVP constituents by duplicating all of our VP productions, substituting GerundV for V.
 GerundVP → GerundV NP
 | GerundV PP | GerundV | GerundV NP PP
 GerundV can then be defined as
 GerundV → being | arriving | leaving | . . .
 The phrases in italics below are examples of the two other common kinds of
 non-finite clauses, infinitives and -ed forms:
 F.3 • S OME G RAMMAR RULES FOR E NGLISH 11

 the last flight to arrive in Boston
 I need to have dinner served
 Which is the aircraft used by this flight?
 A postnominal relative clause (more correctly a restrictive relative clause), is
 relative
 pronoun a clause that often begins with a relative pronoun (that and who are the most common). The relative pronoun functions as the subject of the embedded verb in the
 following examples:

 a flight that serves breakfast
 flights that leave in the morning
 the one that leaves at ten thirty five
 We might add rules like the following to deal with these:
 Nominal → Nominal RelClause
 RelClause → (who | that) VP
 The relative pronoun may also function as the object of the embedded verb, as
 in the following example; we leave for the reader the exercise of writing grammar
 rules for more complex relative clauses of this kind.

 the earliest American Airlines flight that I can get
 Various postnominal modifiers can be combined:
 a flight [from Phoenix to Detroit] [leaving Monday evening]
 evening flights [from Nashville to Houston] [that serve dinner]
 a friend [living in Denver] [that would like to visit me in DC]

 Before the Noun Phrase
predeterminers Word classes that modify and appear before NPs are called predeterminers. Many
 of these have to do with number or amount; a common predeterminer is all:
 all the flights all flights all non-stop flights
 The example noun phrase given in Fig. F.5 illustrates some of the complexity
 that arises when these rules are combined.

 F.3.4 The Verb Phrase
 The verb phrase consists of the verb and a number of other constituents. In the
 simple rules we have built so far, these other constituents include NPs and PPs and
 combinations of the two:
 VP → Verb disappear
 VP → Verb NP prefer a morning flight
 VP → Verb NP PP leave Boston in the morning
 VP → Verb PP leaving on Thursday
 Verb phrases can be significantly more complicated than this. Many other kinds
 of constituents, such as an entire embedded sentence, can follow the verb. These are
 sentential
 complements called sentential complements:
 You [VP [V said [S you had a two hundred sixty-six dollar fare]]
 [VP [V Tell] [NP me] [S how to get from the airport to downtown]]
 I [VP [V think [S I would like to take the nine thirty flight]]

 the Nom GerundiveVP

 Nom PP leaving before 10

Figure F.5 A parse tree for “all the morning flights from Denver to Tampa leaving before 10”.

 Here’s a rule for these:

 VP → Verb S

 Similarly, another potential constituent of the VP is another VP. This is often the
 case for verbs like want, would like, try, intend, need:
 I want [VP to fly from Milwaukee to Orlando]
 Hi, I want [VP to arrange three flights]
 While a verb phrase can have many possible kinds of constituents, not every
 verb is compatible with every verb phrase. For example, the verb want can be used
 either with an NP complement (I want a flight . . . ) or with an infinitive VP complement (I want to fly to . . . ). By contrast, a verb like find cannot take this sort of VP
 complement (* I found to fly to Dallas).
 This idea that verbs are compatible with different kinds of complements is a very
 transitive old one; traditional grammar distinguishes between transitive verbs like find, which
 intransitive take a direct object NP (I found a flight), and intransitive verbs like disappear,
 which do not (*I disappeared a flight).
 subcategorize Where traditional grammars subcategorize verbs into these two categories (transitive and intransitive), modern grammars distinguish as many as 100 subcategories.
 subcategorizes We say that a verb like find subcategorizes for an NP, and a verb like want subfor
 categorizes for either an NP or a non-finite VP. We also call these constituents the
 complements complements of the verb (hence our use of the term sentential complement above).
 So we say that want can take a VP complement. These possible sets of complements
subcategorization are called the subcategorization frame for the verb. Another way of talking about
 frame
 the relation between the verb and these other constituents is to think of the verb as
 a logical predicate and the constituents as logical arguments of the predicate. So we
 can think of such predicate-argument relations as FIND (I, A FLIGHT ) or WANT (I, TO
 FLY ). We talk more about this view of verbs and arguments in Appendix F when we
 talk about predicate calculus representations of verb semantics. Subcategorization
 frames for a set of example verbs are given in Fig. F.6.
 F.3 • S OME G RAMMAR RULES FOR E NGLISH 13

 NP prefer, find, leave Find [NP the flight from Pittsburgh to Boston]

 NP PPwith help, load Can you help [NP me] [PP with a flight]
 VPto prefer, want, need I would prefer [VPto to go by United Airlines]
 S mean Does this mean [S AA has a hub in Boston]
Figure F.6 Subcategorization frames for a set of example verbs.

 We can capture the association between verbs and their complements by making
 separate subtypes of the class Verb (e.g., Verb-with-NP-complement, Verb-with-Inf-
VP-complement, Verb-with-S-complement, and so on):

 Verb-with-NP-complement → find | leave | repeat | . . .
 Verb-with-S-complement → think | believe | say | . . .
 Verb-with-Inf-VP-complement → want | try | need | . . .

 Each VP rule could then be modified to require the appropriate verb subtype:

 VP → Verb-with-no-complement disappear
 VP → Verb-with-NP-comp NP prefer a morning flight
 VP → Verb-with-S-comp S said there were two flights

 A problem with this approach is the significant increase in the number of rules and
 the associated loss of generality.

 F.3.5 Coordination
 conjunctions The major phrase types discussed here can be conjoined with conjunctions like and,
 coordinate or, and but to form larger constructions of the same type. For example, a coordinate
 noun phrase can consist of two other noun phrases separated by a conjunction:
 Please repeat [NP [NP the flights] and [NP the costs]]
 I need to know [NP [NP the aircraft] and [NP the flight number]]
 Here’s a rule that allows these structures:

 NP → NP and NP

 Note that the ability to form coordinate phrases through conjunctions is often
 used as a test for constituency. Consider the following examples, which differ from
 the ones given above in that they lack the second determiner.
 Please repeat the [Nom [Nom flights] and [Nom costs]]
 I need to know the [Nom [Nom aircraft] and [Nom flight number]]
 The fact that these phrases can be conjoined is evidence for the presence of the
 underlying Nominal constituent we have been making use of. Here’s a rule for this:

 Nominal → Nominal and Nominal

 The following examples illustrate conjunctions involving VPs and Ss.
14 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 What flights do you have [VP [VP leaving Denver] and [VP arriving in
 San Francisco]]
 [S [S I’m interested in a flight from Dallas to Washington] and [S I’m
 also interested in going to Baltimore]]
 The rules for VP and S conjunctions mirror the NP one given above.
 VP → VP and VP
 S → S and S
 Since all the major phrase types can be conjoined in this fashion, it is also possible
 to represent this conjunction fact more generally; a number of grammar formalisms
 metarules such as GPSG (Gazdar et al., 1985) do this using metarules like:
 X → X and X
 This metarule states that any non-terminal can be conjoined with the same nonterminal to yield a constituent of the same type; the variable X must be designated
 as a variable that stands for any non-terminal rather than a non-terminal itself.

F.4 Treebanks
 Sufficiently robust grammars consisting of context-free grammar rules can be used
 to assign a parse tree to any sentence. This means that it is possible to build a
 corpus where every sentence in the collection is paired with a corresponding parse
 treebank tree. Such a syntactically annotated corpus is called a treebank. Treebanks play
 an important role in parsing, as we discuss in Chapter 18, as well as in linguistic
 investigations of syntactic phenomena.
 A wide variety of treebanks have been created, generally through the use of
 parsers (of the sort described in the next few chapters) to automatically parse each
 sentence, followed by the use of humans (linguists) to hand-correct the parses. The
Penn Treebank Penn Treebank project (whose POS tagset we introduced in Chapter 17) has produced treebanks from the Brown, Switchboard, ATIS, and Wall Street Journal corpora of English, as well as treebanks in Arabic and Chinese. A number of treebanks
 use the dependency representation we will introduce in Chapter 19, including many
 that are part of the Universal Dependencies project (Nivre et al., 2016).

 F.4.1 Example: The Penn Treebank Project
 Figure F.7 shows sentences from the Brown and ATIS portions of the Penn Treebank.2 Note the formatting differences for the part-of-speech tags; such small differences are common and must be dealt with in processing treebanks. The Penn
 Treebank part-of-speech tagset was defined in Chapter 17. The use of LISP-style
 parenthesized notation for trees is extremely common and resembles the bracketed
 notation we saw earlier in (F.1). For those who are not familiar with it we show a
 standard node-and-line tree representation in Fig. F.8.
 Figure F.9 shows a tree from the Wall Street Journal. This tree shows another featraces ture of the Penn Treebanks: the use of traces (-NONE- nodes) to mark long-distance

 releases of English treebanks. We use Treebank III for our examples.

 syntactic dependencies or syntactic movement. For example, quotations often follow a quomovement
 tative verb like say. But in this example, the quotation “We would have to wait until
 we have collected on those assets” precedes the words he said. An empty S containing only the node -NONE- marks the position after said where the quotation sentence
 often occurs. This empty node is marked (in Treebanks II and III) with the index 2,
 as is the quotation S at the beginning of the sentence. Such co-indexing may make it
 easier for some parsers to recover the fact that this fronted or topicalized quotation
 is the complement of the verb said. A similar -NONE- node marks the fact that there
 is no syntactic subject right before the verb to wait; instead, the subject is the earlier
 NP We. Again, they are both co-indexed with the index 1.
 The Penn Treebank II and Treebank III releases added further information to
 make it easier to recover the relationships between predicates and arguments. Certain phrases were marked with tags indicating the grammatical function of the phrase
 (as surface subject, logical topic, cleft, non-VP predicates) its presence in particular
 text categories (headlines, titles), and its semantic function (temporal phrases, lo-

 -SBJ (surface subject) and -TMP (temporal phrase) tags. Figure F.8 shows in addition the -PRD tag, which is used for predicates that are not VPs (the one in Fig. F.8
 is an ADJP). We’ll return to the topic of grammatical function when we consider
 dependency grammars and parsing in Chapter 19.

 F.4.2 Treebanks as Grammars
 The sentences in a treebank implicitly constitute a grammar of the language represented by the corpus being annotated. For example, from the three parsed sentences
 in Fig. F.7 and Fig. F.9, we can extract each of the CFG rules in them. For simplicity,
 let’s strip off the rule suffixes (-SBJ and so on). The resulting grammar is shown in
 Fig. F.10.
 The grammar used to parse the Penn Treebank is relatively flat, resulting in very
 many and very long rules. For example, among the approximately 4,500 different
 rules for expanding VPs are separate rules for PP sequences of any length and every
 possible arrangement of verb arguments:
 VP → VBD PP
 VP → VBD PP PP
 VP → VBD PP PP PP
 VP → VBD PP PP PP PP
 VP → VB ADVP PP
 VP → VB PP ADVP
 VP → ADVP VB PP
 as well as even longer rules, such as
 VP → VBP PP PP PP PP PP ADVP PP

 The last two of those rules, for example, come from the following two noun phrases:

 [FW de] [NNP Industria]
[NP Shearson’s] [JJ easy-to-film], [JJ black-and-white] “[SBAR Where We Stand]” [NNS commercials]
 Viewed as a large grammar in this way, the Penn Treebank III Wall Street Journal
 corpus, which contains about 1 million words, also has about 1 million non-lexical
 rule tokens, consisting of about 17,500 distinct rule types.

 Various facts about the treebank grammars, such as their large numbers of flat
 rules, pose problems for probabilistic parsing algorithms. For this reason, it is common to make various modifications to a grammar extracted from a treebank. We
 discuss these further in Appendix C.

 F.4.3 Heads and Head-Finding
 We suggested informally earlier that syntactic constituents could be associated with
 a lexical head; N is the head of an NP, V is the head of a VP. This idea of a head
 for each constituent dates back to Bloomfield 1914, and is central to the dependency
 grammars and dependency parsing we’ll introduce in Chapter 19. Heads are also
 important in probabilistic parsing (Appendix C) and in constituent-based grammar
 formalisms like Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994)..
 In one simple model of lexical heads, each context-free rule is associated with
 a head (Charniak 1997, Collins 1999). The head is the word in the phrase that is
 grammatically the most important. Heads are passed up the parse tree; thus, each
 non-terminal in a parse tree is annotated with a single word, which is its lexical
 head. Figure F.11 shows an example of such a tree from Collins (1999), in which
 each non-terminal is annotated with its head.
 For the generation of such a tree, each CFG rule must be augmented to identify
 one right-side constituent to be the head child. The headword for a node is then set to
 the headword of its head child. Choosing these head children is simple for textbook
 examples (NN is the head of NP) but is complicated and indeed controversial for
 most phrases. (Should the complementizer to or the verb be the head of an infinite
 verb phrase?) Modern linguistic theories of syntax generally include a component
 that defines heads (see, e.g., (Pollard and Sag, 1994)).
 An alternative approach to finding a head is used in most practical computational
 systems. Instead of specifying head rules in the grammar itself, heads are identified
 dynamically in the context of trees for specific sentences. In other words, once
 a sentence is parsed, the resulting tree is walked to decorate each node with the
 appropriate head. Most current systems rely on a simple set of handwritten rules,
 such as a practical one for Penn Treebank grammars given in Collins (1999) but
 developed originally by Magerman (1995). For example, the rule for finding the
 head of an NP is as follows (Collins, 1999, p. 238):

 • If the last word is tagged POS, return last-word.
 F.5 • G RAMMAR E QUIVALENCE AND N ORMAL F ORM 19

 • Else search from right to left for the first child which is an NN, NNP, NNPS, NX, POS,
 or JJR.
 • Else search from left to right for the first child which is an NP.
 • Else search from right to left for the first child which is a $, ADJP, or PRN.
 • Else search from right to left for the first child which is a CD.
 • Else search from right to left for the first child which is a JJ, JJS, RB or QP.
 • Else return the last word

 Selected other rules from this set are shown in Fig. F.12. For example, for VP
 rules of the form VP → Y1 · · · Yn , the algorithm would start from the left of Y1 · · ·
 Yn looking for the first Yi of type TO; if no TOs are found, it would search for the
 first Yi of type VBD; if no VBDs are found, it would search for a VBN, and so on.
 See Collins (1999) for more details.

F.5 Grammar Equivalence and Normal Form
 A formal language is defined as a (possibly infinite) set of strings of words. This
 suggests that we could ask if two grammars are equivalent by asking if they generate the same set of strings. In fact, it is possible to have two distinct context-free
 grammars generate the same language.
 We usually distinguish two kinds of grammar equivalence: weak equivalence
 and strong equivalence. Two grammars are strongly equivalent if they generate the
 same set of strings and if they assign the same phrase structure to each sentence
 (allowing merely for renaming of the non-terminal symbols). Two grammars are
 weakly equivalent if they generate the same set of strings but do not assign the same
 phrase structure to each sentence.
 normal form It is sometimes useful to have a normal form for grammars, in which each of
 the productions takes a particular form. For example, a context-free grammar is in
 Chomsky Chomsky normal form (CNF) (Chomsky, 1963) if it is -free and if in addition
 normal form
 each production is either of the form A → B C or A → a. That is, the right-hand side
 of each rule either has two non-terminal symbols or one terminal symbol. Chomsky
 binary
 branching normal form grammars are binary branching, that is they have binary trees (down
 to the prelexical nodes). We make use of this binary branching property in the CKY
 parsing algorithm in Chapter 18.
 Any context-free grammar can be converted into a weakly equivalent Chomsky
 normal form grammar. For example, a rule of the form

 A → B C D
20 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 can be converted into the following two CNF rules (Exercise F.?? asks the reader to
 formulate the complete algorithm):

 A → B X
 X → C D

 Sometimes using binary branching can actually produce smaller grammars. For
 example, the sentences that might be characterized as
 VP -> VBD NP PP*
 are represented in the Penn Treebank by this series of rules:
 VP → VBD NP PP
 VP → VBD NP PP PP
 VP → VBD NP PP PP PP
 VP → VBD NP PP PP PP PP
 ...
 but could also be generated by the following two-rule grammar:
 VP → VBD NP PP
 VP → VP PP
 The generation of a symbol A with a potentially infinite sequence of symbols B with
 Chomskyadjunction a rule of the form A → A B is known as Chomsky-adjunction.

F.6 Summary
 This chapter has introduced a number of fundamental concepts in syntax through
 the use of context-free grammars.
 • In many languages, groups of consecutive words act as a group or a constituent, which can be modeled by context-free grammars (which are also
 known as phrase-structure grammars).
 • A context-free grammar consists of a set of rules or productions, expressed
 over a set of non-terminal symbols and a set of terminal symbols. Formally,
 a particular context-free language is the set of strings that can be derived
 from a particular context-free grammar.
 • A generative grammar is a traditional name in linguistics for a formal language that is used to model the grammar of a natural language.
 • There are many sentence-level grammatical constructions in English; declarative, imperative, yes-no question, and wh-question are four common types;
 these can be modeled with context-free rules.
 • An English noun phrase can have determiners, numbers, quantifiers, and
 adjective phrases preceding the head noun, which can be followed by a number of postmodifiers; gerundive and infinitive VPs are common possibilities.
 • Subjects in English agree with the main verb in person and number.
 • Verbs can be subcategorized by the types of complements they expect. Simple subcategories are transitive and intransitive; most grammars include
 many more categories than these.
 • Treebanks of parsed sentences exist for many genres of English and for many
 languages. Treebanks can be searched with tree-search tools.
 H ISTORICAL N OTES 21

 • Any context-free grammar can be converted to Chomsky normal form, in
 which the right-hand side of each rule has either two non-terminals or a single
 terminal.

Historical Notes
 According to Percival (1976), the idea of breaking up a sentence into a hierarchy of
 constituents appeared in the Völkerpsychologie of the groundbreaking psychologist
 Wilhelm Wundt (Wundt, 1900):
 ...den sprachlichen Ausdruck für die willkürliche Gliederung einer Gesammtvorstellung in ihre in logische Beziehung zueinander gesetzten
 Bestandteile
 [the linguistic expression for the arbitrary division of a total idea
 into its constituent parts placed in logical relations to one another]
 Wundt’s idea of constituency was taken up into linguistics by Leonard Bloomfield in his early book An Introduction to the Study of Language (Bloomfield, 1914).
 By the time of his later book, Language (Bloomfield, 1933), what was then called
 “immediate-constituent analysis” was a well-established method of syntactic study
 in the United States. By contrast, traditional European grammar, dating from the
 Classical period, defined relations between words rather than constituents, and European syntacticians retained this emphasis on such dependency grammars, the subject of Chapter 19.
 American Structuralism saw a number of specific definitions of the immediate
 constituent, couched in terms of their search for a “discovery procedure”: a methodological algorithm for describing the syntax of a language. In general, these attempt
 to capture the intuition that “The primary criterion of the immediate constituent
 is the degree in which combinations behave as simple units” (Bazell, 1952/1966, p.
 284). The most well known of the specific definitions is Harris’ idea of distributional
 similarity to individual units, with the substitutability test. Essentially, the method
 proceeded by breaking up a construction into constituents by attempting to substitute
 simple structures for possible constituents—if a substitution of a simple form, say,
 man, was substitutable in a construction for a more complex set (like intense young
 man), then the form intense young man was probably a constituent. Harris’s test was
 the beginning of the intuition that a constituent is a kind of equivalence class.
 The first formalization of this idea of hierarchical constituency was the phrasestructure grammar defined in Chomsky (1956) and further expanded upon (and
 argued against) in Chomsky (1957) and Chomsky (1956/1975). From this time on,
 most generative linguistic theories were based at least in part on context-free grammars or generalizations of them (such as Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar
 (Pollard and Sag, 1994), Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 1982), the Minimalist Program (Chomsky, 1995), and Construction Grammar (Kay and Fillmore,
 1999), inter alia); many of these theories used schematic context-free templates
 X-bar known as X-bar schemata, which also relied on the notion of syntactic head.
 schemata
 Shortly after Chomsky’s initial work, the context-free grammar was reinvented
 by Backus (1959) and independently by Naur et al. (1960) in their descriptions of
 the ALGOL programming language; Backus (1996) noted that he was influenced by
 the productions of Emil Post and that Naur’s work was independent of his (Backus’)
22 A PPENDIX F • C ONSTITUENCY G RAMMARS

 own. After this early work, a great number of computational models of natural
 language processing were based on context-free grammars because of the early development of efficient algorithms to parse these grammars (see Chapter 18).
 Thre are various classes of extensions to CFGs, many designed to handle longdistance dependencies in the syntax. (Other grammars instead treat long-distancedependent items as being related semantically rather than syntactically (Kay and
 Fillmore 1999, Culicover and Jackendoff 2005).
 One extended formalism is Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) (Joshi, 1985).
 The primary TAG data structure is the tree, rather than the rule. Trees come in two
 kinds: initial trees and auxiliary trees. Initial trees might, for example, represent
 simple sentential structures, and auxiliary trees add recursion into a tree. Trees are
 combined by two operations called substitution and adjunction. The adjunction
 operation handles long-distance dependencies. See Joshi (1985) for more details.
 Tree Adjoining Grammar is a member of the family of mildly context-sensitive
 languages.
 We mentioned on page 15 another way of handling long-distance dependencies,
 based on the use of empty categories and co-indexing. The Penn Treebank uses
 this model, which draws (in various Treebank corpora) from the Extended Standard
 Theory and Minimalism (Radford, 1997).
 Readers interested in the grammar of English should get one of the three large
 reference grammars of English: Huddleston and Pullum (2002), Biber et al. (1999),
 and Quirk et al. (1985).
 There are many good introductory textbooks on syntax from different perspecgenerative tives. Sag et al. (2003) is an introduction to syntax from a generative perspective,
 focusing on the use of phrase-structure rules, unification, and the type hierarchy in
 Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar. Van Valin, Jr. and La Polla (1997) is an
 functional introduction from a functional perspective, focusing on cross-linguistic data and on
 the functional motivation for syntactic structures.

 7. Is there an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Dallas?
 F.3 Assume a grammar that has many VP rules for different subcategorizations, as
 expressed in Section F.3.4, and differently subcategorized verb rules like Verbwith-NP-complement. How would the rule for postnominal relative clauses
 (F.4) need to be modified if we wanted to deal properly with examples like the
 earliest flight that you have? Recall that in such examples the pronoun that is
 the object of the verb get. Your rules should allow this noun phrase but should
 correctly rule out the ungrammatical S *I get.
 F.4 Does your solution to the previous problem correctly model the NP the earliest
 flight that I can get? How about the earliest flight that I think my mother
 wants me to book for her? Hint: this phenomenon is called long-distance
 dependency.
 F.5 Write rules expressing the verbal subcategory of English auxiliaries; for example, you might have a rule verb-with-bare-stem-VP-complement → can.
possessive F.6 NPs like Fortune’s office or my uncle’s marks are called possessive or genitive
 genitive noun phrases. We can model possessive noun phrases by treating the sub-NP
 like Fortune’s or my uncle’s as a determiner of the following head noun. Write
 grammar rules for English possessives. You may treat ’s as if it were a separate
 word (i.e., as if there were always a space before ’s).
 F.7 Page 8 discussed the need for a Wh-NP constituent. The simplest Wh-NP is
 one of the Wh-pronouns (who, whom, whose, which). The Wh-words what
 and which can be determiners: which four will you have?, what credit do you
 have with the Duke? Write rules for the different types of Wh-NPs.
